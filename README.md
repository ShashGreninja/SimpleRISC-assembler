# SimpleRISC-assembler

The repository holds the internal script for a JS-based SimpleRISC assembler. The code in assembler.js accepts a SimpleRISC script, strips it to parts and identifies labels, operations and operands; and converts it to bit stream of zeroes and ones - hence converting it into corresponding machine code.
